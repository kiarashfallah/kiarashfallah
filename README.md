##👋 Hey, I’m Kiarash.

💻 I build automation tools, web scrapers, and data pipelines that handle real-world data efficiently and at scale. I've worked on projects that involve everything from extracting data from tricky websites to automating repetitive tasks across platforms.

🤖 Whether it's scraping, building bots, or automating workflows, I enjoy solving practical problems with code.
📈 I also have experience in data analysis and love turning raw data into meaningful insights.

🛠️ Lately, I’ve been sharpening my skills in Flutter (for mobile/front-end), PyTorch (for deep learning), and C++ (for IoT and hardware-related work). These tools let me explore a mix of mobile, AI, and embedded systems projects.

🚀 I’m always up for collaborating—especially on anything related to scraping, automation, data science, or IoT. Let’s build something useful.
